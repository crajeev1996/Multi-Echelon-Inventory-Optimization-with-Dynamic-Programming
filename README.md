# Multi-Echelon-Inventory-Optimization-with-Dynamic-Programming
This project is a spin off of my Supply Chain Modelling course Case Study which deals with the Inventory Optimization of the Supply Chain Network of a telecom company. The Guaranteed Service Model is used for optimization.

The optimal solution to the Guaranteed Service Model formulation is obtained by a Dynamic Programming algorithm solution introduced by Graves and Willems (2000). The algorithm, pseudo-code and examples shown in this project are borrowed from the Fundamentals of Supply Chain Theory (Snyder and Shen).

The algorithms are implemented in Python and the forward pass solution is compared with the text book example to check if it works. The backward pass hasn't been implemented due to complexity issues and a lack of description in the textbook.
